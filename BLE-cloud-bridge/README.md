The raspberry/flowerPower program :

**Purpose**

This program allow your raspberry to retrieve and upload your sensors' data (the ones associated to your account) automatically and regularly.

**How it works**

The first function is used to read the authentication parameters contained in the params.txt file. 
Each line is read and pushed in the param tab. 

The second function is used to associate each unit of the param tab to the corresponding variable. A new CloudAPI object is created with those four parameters. 

The third function is used to login using the known parameters and to recover all the information that belong to this specific user. 
	> tabSensors contains all the sensors (UUID) associated to the account
	> tabIndex contains the last index from which the history of each sensor was recover

The fourth function is used to put every UUID contained in tabSensors under an understandable format in order to be used in the upcoming functions. Each new UUID is pushed in the uuidTab.

The fifth function is used to scan the BLE environment, each time a BLE device is found its UUID is compared to every UUID contained in the uuidTab. If there is a match between the found device's UUID and one of the UUID contained in the previous mentioned tab this device is pushed in tab at the same index as the one in the uuidTab and so in the tabIndex in order not to mix up the index and the device. This function contains a timeout which stops the discoverAll function after not having found a BLE device within 10 seconds.

The sixth function recovers some information about every sensors contained in tab one at a time. It recovers its history starting form the corresponding index contained in tabIndex. This history is then stored in uuidOfTheSensor.txt. Then the function uploads this history on the web service using the uploadGarden function, which was written for this purpose (this function is found in the flower-power-cloud.js). 


**How to use it**

Installing this program on your raspberry is really easy. It works with any BLE-equipped/BLE-dongle-equipped computers as well.

Let's see how to make it work on a raspberry.
- First, you need a raspberry with a USB BLE dongle. This raspberry must be up and running.
- Then you need to install some required tools on your raspberry.
	First, nodejs needs to be installed, proceed as following 
	
	sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade
	
	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
	sudo apt-get install nodejs
	
	
Then do a node –version to check if it worked.

Then we need to install the BLE libraries, just follow the steps at 
	
	http://www.jaredwolff.com/blog/get-started-with-bluetooth-low-energy/
	

To check if it worked, just do a sudo hcitools lescan, if it shows you a list of surrounding 	BLE devices – or at least your Flower Power -- it worked. 
If not, do a sudo apt-get install bluez and try again.

After that, we need to install npm, we need it to install the program dependencies

	sudo apt-get install npm

- Once everything is setup, we can install the program.
	Create a folder to put the program in. 
	Place yourself in this new folder.
	Do the following commands :
			
		npm install async@1.0.0
		npm install debug
		npm install fs
		npm install lazy
		npm install noble
		npm install node-uuid
		npm install request
		npm install sync
		npm install noble-device@0.1.2
		git clone https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/FlowerPower-Tools.git
		cd node_modules
		git clone https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/node-flower-power.git -b BLE-cloud-bridge 
		git clone https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/node-flower-power-cloud.git

    Tested with the following versions : 
    async@1.0.0
    debug@2.2.0
    fs@0.0.2
    lazy1.0.11
    noble@1.0.2
    node-uuid@1.4.3
    request@2.60.0
    sync@0.2.5
    noble-device@0.1.2

- Before testing the program, you need to edit params.txt with your own credentials, be careful, the order is very important.

- After everything is installed, you can try the program by placing yourself into the PATH_TO_BLE-cloud-bridge folder and by doing a sudo node app.js

- You have now an up and running program, but the purpose of it is to work in an autonomous way. For that, we just need to use the crontab to start the program automatically every 30 minutes for example. Do as following :
	sudo crontab -e 
	Then you can edit the crontab of your raspberry. Edit it by writing in it 
	
		*/30 * * * * cd "PATH_TO BLE-cloud-bridge" && sudo sh scriptForCrontab.sh >> results.log
		
	What we do here is we launch the scritpForCrontab script which will actually launch the program every 30 minutes. 


Now that everything is setup, you can check your sensors' data, updated automatically every 30 minutes at https://myflowerpower.parrot.com/
